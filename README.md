This is an anonymized version of the main repo containing all the code used in the USENIX submission paper.

## Python environment

In case you need to install Conda and are on **linux**, you can run

```sh
source config.sh
```

which will install [mini-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), and create the required environment. In case you already have Conda installed, simply run:

```sh
conda env create -f requirements.yaml
```

to create the computing environment.
